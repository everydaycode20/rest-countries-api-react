# REST Countries API-Frontend Mentor Challenge with React

A few months ago I did this [challenge] (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) using vanilla Javascript but I wanted to do it again this time with React.

[working demo] (https://rest-countries-challenge-react.netlify.app/)

For this project I've used [Intersection Observer API] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) which is a great tool to keep tracking of DOM elements and useful for features like infinite scrolling. For this project I've also used React Hooks like useReducer and Context API.

## How To Use
